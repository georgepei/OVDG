A brief word about the licensing of this book.  This is a free (as in speech)
book.  If you've heard of free software, this is the same idea, only with a book
instead of a computer program.  You now own this book, and while
you can't just do anything you want with it, you have an enormous amount of freedom,
much more than you would ordinarily expect to get with a book.

You can, for instance, make any number of copies of this book.  Give it to your friends,
post it on your own web site, publish it in new media formats.  You can even
add chapters to the book and republish it under a new title without my
consent or even my awareness.  My work is always copyright to me, and your work is
always copyright to you, and your new-and-presumably-improved version must be published
under the same license as this one.  There are a few other obscure details that you
can read all about in the appendix, but that's the basic idea.

There are already several excellent Python books that have gone out of print,
because their publishers decided that it was not in their best interest to continue
publishing them.  That never has to happen to free books.  You have the freedom to keep
this book alive.  If I choose to stop distributing it, you can distribute it yourself.
If I move on and this book goes out of date, you can pick up where I left off and keep
this book current and relevant.

As I write this, the year is 2000, and the Internet is a battleground of intellectual
property disputes.  Some people would like you to believe that, without proper financial
incentives, music, literature, and computer software would disappear.  After all,
who would make music if they can't make money on it?  Who would write?  Who would
program?  I know the answer.  The answer is that musicians will make music, not because
they can make money, but because musicians are the people who can't not make music.
Writers will write because they can't not write.  I've been programming for 16 years,
writing free software for 8.  I can't imagine not doing this.  If you can imagine yourself
not doing what you're doing, do something else.  Do whatever it is that you can't not do.
